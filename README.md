# Academic and individual projects

## [Project 1: Recommendation System](https://github.com/r3qin/Recommendation-System)
* Collaborated with two teammates and created a recommendation system for film audiences
* Designed a hybrid system with collaborative filtering models, factorization machines, and deep learning models
* Utilized tools: NumPy, PySpark, PyTorch, and Matplotlib

## [Project 2: Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/r3qin/bikesharing)
* Led a group of three and conducted exploratory data analysis
* Collected and transformed data for further analysis by R and packages such as dplyr
* Created static and interactive statistical graphs with ggplot2 and D3.js8*
* Showcased analysis report using R markdown and bookdown

## [Project 3: Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://github.com/r3qin/Titanic-Challenge/blob/main/Titanic.ipynb)
* Analyzed data by creating statistical graphs to show relationship between variables and the target
* Implemented machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptron
* Fine-tuned hypoparameters to achieve a higher accuracy
* Achieved 78.7% test accuracy and ranked in top 13%
* Python libraries utilized: NumPy, pandas, seaborn, and sikit-learn

## [Project 4: Kaggle Digit Recognizer Challenge](https://github.com/r3qin/Digit-Recognizer/blob/main/Digit%20Recognizer.ipynb)
* Used convolutional neural network to identify digits in pictures
* Fine-tuned hypoparameters to achieve a higher accuracy
* Achieved 98.989% test accuracy
* Tool utilized: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, PyTorch

## [Project 5: A brief Introduction to Seaborn](https://r3qin.github.io/Community_Contribution/A-brief-introduction-to-seaborn.html)
* This is a class project of STATW 5702 in Columbia. 
* In the class, multiple statistical graphs were studied including histogram, scatterplot, box plot, violin plot, and bar chart.
* Made some examples so that students who are not familiar with seaborn can create graphs mentioned above.
* Used three languages: English, Chinese, and Japanese

## [Project 6: Influence of Holidays on Crime-Rates](https://github.com/r3qin/Influence-of-Holidays-on-Crime-Rates/blob/master/FinalProject.ipynb)
* This is a class project of COGS 108 in UC San Diego
* Collaborated with five group members
* Proposed the hypothesis that there are more crimes committed on major (federal) holidays than on other days of the year (from 2015-2018)
* Showed the number of crime by bar charts
* Conducted several hypothesis testing such as Wilcoxon signed rank test and Monte Carlo Wilcoxon signed rank test
* Concluded the hypothesis should be rejected
